# No critical missing items detected - all essential testing infrastructure is present

# Optional Enhancements (evaluated and decisions made):
enhancements:
  - id: "junit5_migration"
    name: "JUnit 5 Migration"
    description: "Consider migrating from Spock 1.0 to newer version with JUnit 5 support"
    priority: "low"
    reason: "Current Spock 1.0-groovy-2.4 is compatible with Grails 2.5.6 but is older version"
    status: "wontfix"
    decision: "maintain_current"
    rationale: "Current Spock version is stable and compatible with Grails 2.5.6. Migration can be considered during future Grails upgrade."
    
  - id: "test_data_builders"
    name: "Test Data Builders"
    description: "Consider implementing more sophisticated test data builders beyond TaskTestFactory"
    priority: "low"
    reason: "Basic test factory exists but could be enhanced for complex scenarios"
    status: "wontfix"
    decision: "maintain_current"
    rationale: "Current TaskTestFactory meets current testing needs. Enhancement can be added incrementally if needed."
    
  - id: "performance_testing"
    name: "Performance Testing"
    description: "Add performance testing framework (e.g., JMeter, Gatling)"
    priority: "low"
    reason: "No performance testing infrastructure detected"
    status: "wontfix"
    decision: "maintain_current"
    rationale: "Performance testing not required for current scope. Can be added later if performance becomes a concern."
    
  - id: "contract_testing"
    name: "Contract Testing"
    description: "Consider adding contract testing (e.g., Pact) for API testing"
    priority: "low"
    reason: "API testing exists but no contract testing framework detected"
    status: "wontfix"
    decision: "maintain_current"
    rationale: "Current API testing with HTTP client is sufficient. Contract testing can be added if multiple consumers are introduced."
